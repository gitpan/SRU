SRU version 0.1
==========================

Search and Retrieve by URL (SRU) is a RESTful protocol for providing
a search and retrieval web service. The protocol has been developed 
by the Z39.50 International Maintenance Agency to provide a low cost 
alternative to Z39.50 for information providers who want to make
their repositories available with a search/retrieval API. For more 
information about SRU and its SOAP based sibling (SRW) see:
